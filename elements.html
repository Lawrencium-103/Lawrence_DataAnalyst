									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p>I trust this message finds you in good health. I'm excited to introduce myself; my name is Lawrence Oladeji, and I'm on a mission that I believe resonates with your values and aspirations. </p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Meet Me</h2>
									<p>My journey began in 2018 when I started my carrer in the energy sector, working with dedication for a company in Lagos. I have worked as a Technical sales representative and project Engineer. However, I have always been the one that handling any related part of the project with Microsoft of Excel, where I became proficient in Microsoft Excel. Life was thriving until the unforeseen COVID-19 storm hit. The company, like many others, had to navigate through turbulent watersâ€”salaries were reduced, and some of my colleagues had to bid farewell. Though I managed to retain my position, the diminished income posed challenges. In 2019, my passion for data analysis led me to Power BI, a game-changer. Eager to hone my skills, I embarked on a self-learning journey. However, progress was gradual, and I realized I needed structured guidance. That's when I stumbled upon a training center in Lagos offering a two-month Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization program. The program was a financial commitment, costing me 185,000 Naira, but I saw it as an investment in my future.</p>

									<h1><p>ABOUT ME </p></h1>
									
									<h2>Covid -19 Enlightment</h2>
									<p>As the world started to emerge from the shadows of COVID-19, I was ready to offer my expertise in data analysis and visualization services online. Little did I know the hurdles that lay ahead. My initial interactions with potential clients were filled with promise, but as soon as they discovered I was Nigerian, their enthusiasm waned. The stigma surrounding online scams (Yahoo Yahoo)cast a shadow on me. They couldn't see past the stereotype, and one by one, they distanced themselves from me.However, I persevered, and after months of determination, one client was willing to give me a chance. He proposed paying me after the job was done, a leap of faith he was willing to take. I poured my heart and skills into the project, and it was a resounding success. That moment marked a turning pointâ€”the first step into the world of paid freelance work.</p>
									<h2>Help Me Make a Difference:</h2>
									<p>Today, I find myself at a pivotal juncture. Nigeria is grappling with a surplus of graduates facing the harsh reality of unemployment. I see an opportunity, a chance to guide these young minds toward legitimate means of earning a living. My mission is clearâ€”I've initiated training programs for youths in data analysis, visualization, and statistics. These skills are their tickets to success in the global technology job market.</p>
									<h2>My mission unfolds in three phases:</h2>
									<p><strong>1. Create Awareness:</strong> Through training sessions across Nigeria, I aspire to kindle the flame of hope in these young hearts. We've already conducted enlightening programs, such as the one in Akinyele Local Government, where Nigerian youths are encouraged to pursue legitimate careers.</p>

									<p><strong>2. Build a Digital Garage Hub:</strong> Our vision is to establish a hubâ€”a sanctuary of learning with a 100-seat training center. Here, local and peri-urban youths will be introduced to various digital skills. We will help them select the skill that resonates with their aspirations and guide them through a month of intensive learning. Our aim is to provide opportunities to those who are vulnerable to negative influences, ensuring they gain access to these life-changing skills.</p>
									<p><strong>3. Empower Existing Business Owners:</strong> In this phase, our primary focus is to enlighten existing business owners about the vast global business opportunities available. We believe that by expanding their businesses, these entrepreneurs can create jobs and mentor the youth. Moreover, it's crucial to inspire more young Nigerians to start their businesses, reducing unemployment rates and channeling their energy into constructive pursuits. Crucially, this ensures a thriving job market for new digital talent, as opportunities will abound when markets expand, ensuring that fresh talent finds a welcoming ecosystem. With this, I do support youth with business idea on creation of unique and compelling business proposal, discuss use case and feasibility studies of emerging buisness idea and support in my own little way. I also celebrate with friends, colleagues they win too. The picture below is a shot of me with a youn CEO who wo the Global Cleantech Innovation Program. I belive that help others is a WIN WIN. You WIN and I WIN</p>
